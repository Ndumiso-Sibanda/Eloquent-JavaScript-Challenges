Chapter 6:
The Secret Life of Objects
A Vector Type

Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space.

Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectors’ (the one in this and the parameter) x and y values.
