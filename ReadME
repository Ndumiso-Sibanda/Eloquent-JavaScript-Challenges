Chapter 6:
The Secret Life of Objects
A Vector Type

Write a class Vec that represents a vector in two-dimensional space.
It takes x and y parameters (numbers), which it should save to properties of the same name.
Give the Vec prototype two methods, plus and minus, that take another vector as a parameter and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectorsâ€™ (the one in this and the parameter) x and y values.
